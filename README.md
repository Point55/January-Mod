 Foxes and Reindeer in MC 1.12.2

Reindeer are rideable and graze like sheep. They come in many color variants and are breedable with apples and other kinds of food. They can also be tamed. A stick is used to give them commands. They also build caravans like Llamas.

Foxes sleep during the day in a sheltered place and wake up at night to hunt chickens. They can be tamed (similar to ocelot taming) by giving them rabbit meat, and also be bred. They can sit and follow. But mostly they're just cute.

Geckolib for 1.12.2 is a necessary dependency for this.
Use Hwyla for gender info upon looking at them.

Beware of bugs - I can't guarantee I'm able to fix them all.
